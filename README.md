# CS3510-SimpleSceneViewer
Simple scene viewers from Computer Graphics class

This project requires LWJGL v3.1.x


Run Viewer3.java with an input file argument and paths to the appropriate LWJGL libraries to generate a simple scene.  The Viewer will have issues as the program will effectively divide model views by zero.
